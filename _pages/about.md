I am deeply committed to improving transportation systems with a focus on enhancing safety, efficiency, and sustainability. My work focuses on optimizing traffic signal systems to reduce congestion, improve traffic flow, and minimize emissions, creating smarter and more responsive cities. By refining public transit systems, I strive to make them more reliable, accessible, and efficient, thereby encouraging greater public adoption and reducing dependency on private vehicles.

Additionally, I have a keen interest in promoting active transportation modes, such as cycling and walking, to foster healthier communities and reduce environmental impacts. My expertise also extends to traffic demand modeling, where I analyze and predict traffic patterns to design infrastructure that meets the evolving needs of urban environments. These models allow for proactive planning, enabling cities to grow sustainably and avoid congestion issues before they arise.

Driven by curiosity, I am exploring the transformative potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence in transportation. I believe these technologies hold the key to developing cutting-edge mobility solutions like real-time traffic management systems that can respond dynamically to changing conditions.
